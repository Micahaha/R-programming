# there are 3 basic data types in R: numeric, character logical

# the numeric ata type ecompasses integers, doubles, and floats
# double is the default data type
# assgn a value of 15 to a variable
n1 <- 15
n1

# typeof will tell you the data type of the variable it's given
typeof(n1)

# assign a value of 1.5 to a variable
n2 <- 1.5
n2
typeof(n1)

# assign a value of 15 as an integer to a variable
n3 <- as.integer(15)
n3
typeof(n3)

# the character data type encompasses single characters as well as
# strings of characters
# there is no string type in R
# assign the single character "c" to a variable
c1 <- "c"
c1
typeof(c1)

# assign a string of characaters to a variable
c2 <- "a string of characters"
